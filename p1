pygame.event.Event Objects Any time the user does one of several actions such as pressing a keyboard key or moving the mouse on the program’s window, a pygame.event.Event object is created by the Pygame library to record this “event”.
Event objects have a member variable (also called attributes or properties) named type which tells us what kind of event the object represents.

pygame.time.Clock object can help us make sure our program runs at a certain maximum FPS.
pygame.mixer.Sound object Playing sounds that are stored in sound files
soundObj.play() The program execution continues immediately after play() is called
To stop playing the background music immediately, call the pygame.mixer.music.stop()
